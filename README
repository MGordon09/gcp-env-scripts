After running script, go to IAM & Admin -> Organisation Policies
Search for 'Define allowed external IPs for VM instances'
Edit the policy -> create a custom policy -> Select Allow All -> Select Done and save

*Note*
Possible to allow VMs with external IPs with select tags - could allow this for NF vms to allow execution of the workflow
